# Project Holberton School Printf
printf is a C standard library function that formats text and writes it to standard output. An example of the printf function. The name, printf is short for print formatted where print refers to output to a printer although the functions are not limited to printer output.
* The goal of this project is to do our own printf function
* This function only handles 5 specifier:
`%s`
`%c`
`%%`
`%d`
`%i`
## Compilation and how to use :
* U need to compile the code like the following :
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
```
* And then u just need to do ./a.out wich is the output
* If u need a special test or something different than the main.c testing file u can go and modify, it it will not affect the code.
* If u need it copy the main.c we have under this message.
```
int main(void)
{
    int len;
    int len2;
    unsigned int ui;
    void *addr;

    len = _printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
    len2 = printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
    ui = (unsigned int)INT_MAX + 1024;
    addr = (void *)0x7ffe637541f0;
    _printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len, len);
    printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len2, len2);
    _printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -762534);
    printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -762534);
    _printf("Unsigned:[%u]\n", ui);
    printf("Unsigned:[%u]\n", ui);
    _printf("Unsigned octal:[%o]\n", ui);
    printf("Unsigned octal:[%o]\n", ui);
    _printf("Unsigned hexadecimal:[%x, %X]\n", ui, ui);
    printf("Unsigned hexadecimal:[%x, %X]\n", ui, ui);
    _printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
    printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
    _printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
    printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
    _printf("Address:[%p]\n", addr);
    printf("Address:[%p]\n", addr);
    len = _printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
    len2 = printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
    _printf("Len:[%d]\n", len);
    printf("Len:[%d]\n", len2);
    _printf("Unknown:[%r]\n");
    printf("Unknown:[%r]\n");
    return (0);
}
```
## Requirements :
* U need to have unbuntu installed and copy the following repo
* https://github.com/MinutePapillon/holbertonschool-printf.git
* If u need help on the code with more information u can always do **man man_3_printf**
## Exemples :
* Now that u have evrything set up lets try something out
* Be sure to do _printf and not the actual printf
```
_printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
```

* And as u can see we have the good output :D
```
Let's try to printf a simple sentence.
```

# Conclusion
* During this projet we had to work in teams wich some were 3 and others 2 so we had to learn and organize evrything wich was quite hard
* This projet was long and tidious but we managed to do it thanks to my tm8
* Thank you for you're attention and reading all this (don't forget to see the flowchart)
