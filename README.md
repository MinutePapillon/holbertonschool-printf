# Project Holberton School Printf
* The goal of this project is to do our own printf function
* This function only handles 5 specifier:
`%s`
`%c`
`%%`
`%d`
`%i`
## Compilation and how to use :
* U need to compile the code like the following :
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
```
* And then u just need to do ./a.out wich is the output
* If u need a special test or something different than the main.c testing file u can go and modify, it it will not affect the code.

## Requirements :
* U need to have unbuntu installed and copy the following repo
* https://github.com/MinutePapillon/holbertonschool-printf.git
* If u need help on the code with more information u can always do **man man_3_printf**
## Exemples :
* Now that u have evrything set up lets try something out
* Be sure to do _printf and not the actual printf
